# Analysis-of-Obesity-and-Physical-Activity-Trends-Across-States
This mini project focuses on analysing obesity and physical activity trends across different states over multiple years using public health data. The objective of the project is to clean and prepare the dataset using Excel and Power Query, and then build an interactive dashboard using Power BI to identify trends, regional differences, and gender-based variations in health indicators. The project aims to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven understanding of public health patterns.

# Tools Used
Microsoft Excel and Power BI 

# Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel & Power Query)
   - i) Imported the raw dataset into Microsoft Excel and converted it into a structured table with headers.
   - ii)	Used Power Query Editor in Excel to:
       - •	Rename columns for better clarity (LocationDesc as State, Data_Value as Value)
 • Set appropriate data types for numeric and text fields
 •	Remove rows with missing or null values in the Sex and Value columns
 •	Filter the Class to relevant indicator categories such as Obesity and Physical Activity
 •	Filter gender values to include only Male and Female
