# Analysis-of-Obesity-and-Physical-Activity-Trends-Across-States
This mini project focuses on analysing obesity and physical activity trends across different states over multiple years using public health data. The objective of the project is to clean and prepare the dataset using Excel and Power Query, and then build an interactive dashboard using Power BI to identify trends, regional differences, and gender-based variations in health indicators. The project aims to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven understanding of public health patterns.
